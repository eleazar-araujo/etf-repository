= Testing data sets

There are seven categories for the Annex I data themes, one for each theme that specifies spatial objects:

* Addresses
* Administrative Units
* Cadastral Parcels
* Geographical Names
* Hydrography
* Protected Sites
* Transport Networks

Additionally, there is the _Interoperable data sets in GML_ category which
contains test suites for conformance classes applicable to all interoperable data
sets encoded in GML, for any INSPIRE data theme. All Annex I test suites invoke
automatically the test suites in this category.

To validate an INSPIRE data set in GML for full conformance, select all test suites
in the appropriate category. For example, for a data set containing addresses
scroll to the *Data Theme: Addresses (Data Specification version 3.1)*
category and select all 4 conformance classes by clicking on the 'use' flip switch on the right-hand side:

* Application schema, Addresses
* Data consistency, Addresses
* Information accessibility, Addresses
* Reference systems, Addresses

Afterwards click on the *Start* button.

The files can either be uploaded or used by the INSPIRE validator by providing a URL.

NOTE: The Validator only accepts files with XML and GML file extension and ZIP
files containing these two file types. All other files like schema files cannot
be used and are silently ignored by the Validator!

== File upload
If the files are locally stored on your system use the
_Data source_ selector in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog and select
*File Upload*.

After clicking on *Choose files* one or multiple files can be selected. The files
are uploaded and the *Choose files* button becomes inactive. Once the upload
finishes, the *Start* button can be clicked to start the test.

Further steps are described in the
link:http://docs.etf-validator.net/User_manuals/Simplified_workflows.html#_test_run_configuration[standard manual].

== Reference remote files by URL
If the data is available on the web, they can be tested by entering a single URL.
Use the _Data source_ selector and select *Remote file (URL)* in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog.

Then enter the URL to either one XML, GML or ZIP file - or the URL of a query to your
download service that returns one of these file types.
If the URL requires authentication, username and password can be provided by clicking on __Credentials__.

Afterwards start the test by clicking on *Start*
