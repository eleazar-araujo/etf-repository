= Testing download services

You can either test a service against the requirements related to the _Pre-Defined Dataset Download Service using Atom_ or test a
service against the requirements related to the _Pre-Defined Dataset Download
Service using WFS_.

NOTE: The conformance class for a _Direct Access Download Service using WFS_ does not specify any requirements in addition to the requirements in the OGC Web Feature Service standard. Therefore, currently not test suite is provided for this conformance class until the relevant OGC WFS test suites are supported.

NOTE: The conformance classes for coverage data (WCS) and observation data (SOS) are not yet supported.

The Download Service Tests are located in the category
_Download Services (Technical Guidance version 3.1)_.
