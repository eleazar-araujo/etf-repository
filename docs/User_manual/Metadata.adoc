= Testing metadata records

The Metadata test suites are located in the category _Metadata (Technical Guidance version 1.3)_.

NOTE: Version 2.0 of the technical guidance is not yet supported.

To test one or multiple *ISO 19115/19119 metadata encoded in XML* files, click on the 'use' flip switch on the right-hand side of the Test Suite *Conformance class: Metadata for interoperability*. Afterwards click on "Start".

The files can either be uploaded or used remotely by the INSPIRE validator by providing an URL.

NOTE: The Validator only accepts files with XML and GML file ending and ZIP files containing these two file types.
All other files like schema files can not be used and are silently ignored by the Validator.

== File upload
If the files are locally stored on your system use the _Data source_ selector
in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog and select *File Upload*.

After clicking on *Choose files* one or multiple files can be selected. The files
are uploaded and the *Choose files* button becomes inactive. Once the upload
finishes, the *Start* button can be clicked to start the test.

Further steps are described in the

== Reference remote files by URL
If the metadata records are available on the web, they can be tested by entering a single URL.
Use the _Data source_ selector and select *Remote file (URL)* in the _Configure Test Run_ dialog.

Then enter the URL to either a XML or ZIP file - or the URL of a query to your
discovery service that returns one of these file types.

If the URL requires authentication, username and password can be provided by clicking on __Credentials__.

Afterwards start the test by clicking on *Start*
