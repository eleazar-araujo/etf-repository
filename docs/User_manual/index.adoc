= Quick start guide
This document serves as a quick start guide for users of the INSPIRE validator.

The INSPIRE requirements to be tested are grouped in several Conformance Classes
that cover specific aspects. In order to be conformant to a specific
Conformance Class, a service, a metadata record or a data set has to pass all
tests that are defined for that Conformance Class. The INSPIRE validator
provides a Test Suite for each Conformance Class.
